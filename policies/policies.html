                <p>This Cookies Policy applies whenever you visit a website on the Fansocial.com domain, unless expressly stated otherwise (collectively, the “Websites” and each a “Website”). Other than the Websites, this Cookies Policy does not apply to any of our services, ppv, products and content, which are each subject to their own, separate, notices.</p>

                <p>On the Websites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (SDKs), pixels and local storage. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. Tracking technologies are used by most website providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure web security, understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences and generally improve the user experience.</p>

                            <h3 class="section__title">What technologies are used?</h3>
                            <p><span class="section__subtitle">Cookies:</span>  Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above. Cookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers to those websites.</p>
                            <p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Session cookies cannot be used to track your browser or device from website to website.</p>
                            <p>Other cookies are "persistent cookies", meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device.</p>
                            <p><span class="section__subtitle">SDKs:</span> SDKs are pieces of code that enable data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website. Like cookies, they generally operate by assigning your device a unique number.</p>
                            <p>Pixels (also called beacons or tags): Pixels are small 1 pixel x 1 pixel invisible image files that are embedded in certain website pages or emails.  They can be used to collect information about your visit to that website page or to record the fact you opened an email.</p>
                            <p>When you open a website page or email with an embedded pixel, the page or email will automatically run simple code that downloads the 1x1 image file to your browser or device.  At the same time, the code also passes certain information about your device and your actions on the website, or the fact that you opened the email, to the website server. Your interest in the website or email can then be logged and used for analytics or advertising purposes.</p>
                            <p><span class="section__subtitle">Local storage:</span> Local storage files are created by websites to store information locally on your device. They are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device to cookies). Local storage is normally used to speed up site functionality and remember your preferences.</p>

                            <p>Tracking technologies can either be “First-party” or “Third-party”. First-party tracking technologies refers to tracking technologies that we set and use directly. Third-party tracking technologies refer to tracking technologies set by third parties (such as our analytics or advertising service providers) through our Websites.</p>
                            <p>The types of tracking technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the Websites can be classified into one of four categories, namely (i) "Strictly necessary", (ii) "Functionality", (iii) "Analytics and performance" (iv) "Advertising and marketing". We have set out some further general information about each of these categories below.</p>

                            <p>All users must have their identity verified if they want to access any feature of our website. For verification, we need 2 things:</p>
                            <p>Your ID with your photo on it is a photo of you holding your ID next to your face.</p>
                            <p>This verification is mandatory for all Users. We at our sole discretion may request from a User to verify its identity at any time and for any reason we reasonably believe it is necessary.</p>
                            <p>Once the User completes the account verification procedure, the content will be moderated by our moderation team and if it complies with the relevant rules and regulations will be published on the User’s account automatically. Users can start the account verification procedure either through their profile or by accessing the features of the Website. Users must provide a clear copy of a valid government issued identification document with a photo and a selfie holding the identification document. Failure to comply with a verification request, providing false or misleading information during the verification process or attempting to circumvent our verification review systems, may lead to a permanent block of the User’s account and the access to the Website.</p>

Fees for tokens must be paid in advance.</p>
                            <p>In order to make a purchase, you may be asked to supply certain information to allow us to process and authorise your purchase, including, without limitation, your name, address, card number, card expiration date, card security number and other information. You represent and warrant that (i) you have the legal right to use the form of payment that you use and that (ii) the information that you are providing with that form of payment is true and correct.

                            <p>We reserve the right to refuse, cancel or terminate your order for any time and for any reason at our sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to refuse, cancel or terminate your order because of product or service unavailability, errors in the description or price of our product or service and errors in your order.</p>
                            <p>YOUR FILED PAYMENT DETAILS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED FOR YOUR FUTURE PURCHASES OR FOR ANY RECURRING PURCHASES WHICH YOU HAVE AUTHORISED. YOU HEREBY AUTHORISE US AND OUR AGENTS (INCLUDING PAYMENT PROCESSORS WE MAY USE) TO CHARGE YOUR FILED PAYMENT DETAILS FOR SUCH PAYMENTS ON YOUR BEHALF.</p>
                            <p>By enabling the auto-refill feature on the Website, you hereby expressly give your permission for us to automatically charge your last payment details on file, with an amount equivalent to your last purchase, as soon as the tokens in your account get below a chosen threshold. You can always opt-out from the auto-refill feature at any time, by going to your account's “Settings”.</p>
                            <p>You agree not to report as fraudulent, lost or stolen any form of payment which you have used in conjunction with payment to us, for which you do not have a good faith reason to believe is in fact fraudulent, lost or stolen.

                            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, we may in our discretion refund you tokens when there are technical problems with the Website (i.e., when the Website malfunctions and takes your tokens) or when you have had a provably unsatisfactory private show (in which case, you must end the show as soon as possible). However, we will never refund tokens when you have given a tip (as tips are gifts and cannot be reversed) or when you are spying on another person’s private show.</p>
                            <p>Inactive accounts:</p>
                            <p>If a period of inactivity is detected in your account (ie you neither use your account nor purchase any tokens), then we reserve the right and at our sole discretion to terminate your rights to use the Website.</p>
                            <p>In such a case, you hereby expressly accept, agree and acknowledge that any portion of your unused tokens is forfeited by you and cannot subsequently be recovered.</p>
